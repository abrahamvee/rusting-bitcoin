## RESOURCES
List of some of the resources that I use to study and prepare the material.

### Cryptography basics 
- Lectures: Introduction to cryptography: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aHkqB2-46k&list=PL6N5qY2nvvJE8X75VkXglSrVhLv1tVcfy&index=1&t=0s

- Modular arithemtic: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography

- Other Youtube Channels: Computerphile

- The Rust Programming Language Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html

- Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song (Book)

## EPISODE 0
Quick introduction to the channel, and environment setup to follow along.

## EPISODE 1
Covers the following subjects.

### Rust 
- How to represent them (Structs)
- How to work with them (Behaviors/ Associated functions) -> implementation blocks 

### Cryptography
- What are finite fields? e.g. 
    - FF13 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12} (order p^k)
- Why are we interested in them? How do we work with them? (Operations)
- Additional resources to consult
