## OVERVIEW

Project for implementing the basics of crypto, learning Rust, and messing around with stuff.

## MODULAR ARITHMETIC

- What are finite fields? (order p^k)
    - FF13 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- How do we work with them? addition 7 + 8 = 15 mod 13 = 2
- Additional resources
- Why are we interested in them?

## Rust 
- How to represent them (Structs)
- How to work with them (Behaviors/ Associated functions)
